Freudian Slipper
================

Small project for "mirroring" websites and adding some "humorous" content to them.

Freudifier is made with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) 1.3.1 and the app 
structure is made to be compatible with [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/). 
Currently app is coded with python 2.7.1 (though Heroku uses 2.7.2).

Where?
------

Working version can be found at: http://freudifier.herokuapp.com

How?
----

Basically the application gets the source code of the typed URL, then parses it
with [beautifulsoup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/), changes "all" 
(working on it) relative paths to absolute
paths and all the links to go via the application's site. Then it does part of 
speech tagging of webpage's visible text with [nltk](http://nltk.org/) and replaces words depending on 
the part of speech and [Levenshtein distance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) 
to some other words from ``freudifier/slip/sexuality.txt``. This is somehow supposed to be funny.

Most original tarts of the application can be found from [freudifier/slip/utils.py](https://github.com/assamite/Slipper/blob/master/freudifier/slip/utils.py)

Setup
-----

Here are the setup steps you need to take to make this app running on your local computer.
For more thorough information of used technologies check the technologies' own documentations.

[Setup GIT](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) and python 2.7.x obviously.

Clone this repository locally.

	$ git clone https://github.com/assamite/Slipper.git

Download [virtualenv](http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/) and read the documentation (basically activate/deactivate)
	

Create new virtual environment to this folder.
	
	$ virtualenv venv
	
*If you use another name, remember to add it to .gitignore*
	
Activate virtual environment.
	
	$ source venv/bin/activate
	
Download all the requirements for the project with:
	
	(venv)$ pip install -r requirements.txt
	
If you don't have nltk installed before this you can either:

Download needed nltk data

	$ python
	>>> import nltk
	>>> nltk.download()
	
This should open a downloader which you can use to download needed data files.
Currently app is only using punkt-tokenizer with english pickle and maxent treebank pos tagger 
also with english pickle. You can of course download all the data if you want, but it will take 
some time and disc space.

**Or** you can change environment variable ``$NLTK_DATA`` to represent ``nltk_data/``. 

	(venv)$Â NLTK_DATA=path/to/project/root/nltk_data/
	
If you are using [virtualenvwrapper](http://www.doughellmann.com/projects/virtualenvwrapper/) it is recommended to add above mentioned line to ``venv/bin/postactivate``,
otherwise you have to set the variable every time you activate ``venv``.
	
Now you should have all the requirements installed and nltk should be able to found needed data.
After this you just have to run the Django's development server to be able to access site on your
local browser.

	(venv)$ cd freudifier
	(venv)$ python manage.py runserver
	
*(Stop it with CTRL-C)*
	
Then you can access the webpage in your browser: http://127.0.0.1:8000/
Remember to always activate virtualenv before trying to run the server!	

When you are *not* currently anymore running the project you can exit virtual environment.
	
	(venv)$ deactivate
	
Hopefully I didn't miss a step in here.
